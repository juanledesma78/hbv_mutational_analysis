and the results have been recorded in /home/phe.gov.uk/juan.ledesma/EIO_VRD_Bioinformatician/BBVU/hbv_mutational_analysis/Testing - 2022 Sequencing Data/April 2022/E1736 + E1739/Results_E1736 + E1739_hbvma_v1.0.xlsx. 



<<< WARNING >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

No record was found in the CSV file for the samples/sequences 

19_H22500009, 42_Neg, 4_H221440905, 5_H221460060, 6_H221480010, 8_H221480012, 9_H221480013

so they were EXCLUDED from the analysis. 

Check for potential typos, confirm that the sequences belong to the current run, 
confirm the the tube number in the sequence ID uses the same notation as in the 
csv file (i.e 01 is different to 1), etc...
