--- OUTPUT ---------------------------------------------------------------

The folowing samples were ANALYSED for 

X REGION and PRECORE:


13_H220740535 


and 

for SURFACE and POLYMERASE (RT domain):


11_H220720198, 13_H220740535, 14_H220741078, 15_H220741079


and the results have been recorded in /home/phe.gov.uk/juan.ledesma/EIO_VRD_Bioinformatician/BBVU/hbv_mutational_analysis/Testing - 2022 Sequencing Data/Feb 2022/E1701/Results_E1701_hbvma_v1.0.xlsx. 



<<< WARNING >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

No record was found in the CSV file for the samples/sequences 

4_H220420139, 5_H220660171, 6_H220660188, 7_H220680228, 9_H220720196

so they were EXCLUDED from the analysis. 

Check for potential typos, confirm that the sequences belong to the current run, 
confirm the the tube number in the sequence ID uses the same notation as in the 
csv file (i.e 01 is different to 1), etc...
