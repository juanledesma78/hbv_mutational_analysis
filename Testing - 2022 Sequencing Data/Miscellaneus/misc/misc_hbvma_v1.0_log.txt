<<< WARNING >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

No record was found in the CSV file for the samples/sequences 

39_H214640176-NOT-IN-CSV, 78_H214541105-NOT-IN-CSV

so they were EXCLUDED from the analysis. 

Check for potential typos, confirm that the sequences belong to the current run, 
confirm the the tube number in the sequence ID uses the same notation as in the 
csv file (i.e 01 is different to 1), etc...
